# Python Developer Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains my completed Python developer assessment tasks.
It demonstrates Python basics, Git & GitHub workflows, code styling, data structures, OOP, debugging, error handling, and API interaction.

## Project Structure & Tasks Completed
- [Task 1.1 - Hello Developers!](hello.py)
- [Task 1.2 - Git Basics](README.md)
- [Task 1.3 - Code Style](bad_style.py)
- [Task 2.1 - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](dsa_challenges.py)
- [Task 2.2 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](book_store.py)
- [Task 2.3 - Debugging & Error Handling](debug_errors.py)
- [Task 3.1 - API Interaction](api_client.py)


## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
```markdown
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GurramPranaykumar/python-dev-assessment.git
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher

## Dependencies
- requests (used for API interaction)

### Install dependencies
```markdown
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Run the code
```markdown
```bash
python <filename>.py
```

## Reflections

### Challenges
Managing merge conflicts and maintaining consistent code style across multiple branches was one of the main challenges during this assessment..

### Interesting Parts
Interacting with APIs and handling error debugging was particularly engaging and helped me understand real-world scenarios better.

### Learnings
I improved my Git skills (branching, merging, and resolving conflicts) and deepened my understanding of Python debugging and OOP concepts.
